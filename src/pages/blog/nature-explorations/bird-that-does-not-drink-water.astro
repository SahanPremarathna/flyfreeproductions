      <h2>Who Is This Bird?</h2>
      <p>
        The bird in question is the <strong
          >Malabar Pied Hornbill (Anthracoceros coronatus)</strong
        >, a striking and rare species found in the forests of Sri Lanka and
        parts of the Indian subcontinent. With its oversized yellow-and-black
        casque sitting proudly atop its bill, this hornbill is not only visually
        captivating but also behaviorally fascinating.

      <h2>How Does It Hydrate Itself?</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike many birds, the Malabar Pied Hornbill doesn't drink water in the
        traditional sense. Its massive beak makes it awkward and difficult to
        sip from ponds or streams. Instead, it survives by consuming juicy,
        water-rich fruits like figs, berries, and other seasonal forest produce.
        These fruits provide both nutrition and hydration, sustaining the bird
        even in dry environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, not all hornbills follow this rule. In Africa, some
        hornbill species—like the Southern Yellow-billed Hornbill—are observed
        drinking water directly from sources when available. This shows that
        while hydration strategies vary, the Malabar Pied Hornbill has evolved
        to rely almost entirely on its fruit diet.

      <h2>General Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Hornbills are highly social birds. The Malabar Pied Hornbill often moves
        in packs, filling the forest with their loud calls and heavy wingbeats.
        They are usually seen flying in small groups, and pairs are particularly
        inseparable—often staying side by side whether perching or flying.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are also highly territorial. Their loud, croaking calls echo
        through the forest canopy, serving both as communication within the
        flock and as a way to mark their presence.
      </p>

      <h2>A Remarkable Family Ritual</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most extraordinary behavior of the Malabar Pied Hornbill is
        seen during breeding season. The female selects a hollow tree cavity and
        seals herself inside with a wall of mud, droppings, and fruit pulp,
        leaving only a small slit open. She remains trapped in this dark chamber
        for weeks, depending entirely on the male to deliver food through the
        slit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside, she lays eggs and tends to her chicks. During this period, she
        molts most of her feathers, making flight impossible. Once the chicks
        grow large enough and their feathers are developed, the female breaks
        out of her prison. From that point, both parents share the
        responsibility of feeding their young until they are ready to leave the
        nest.
      </p>
      <p>
        This incredible strategy protects the vulnerable female and chicks from
        predators and harsh weather, though it places enormous pressure on the
        male to provide consistently.

      <h2>Ecological Importance</h2>
      <p>
        Malabar Pied Hornbills play a vital role in their ecosystems. By feeding
        on fruits and dispersing seeds over wide areas, they act as key seed
        dispersers, helping regenerate forests. Some tree species are almost
        entirely dependent on hornbills for reproduction.

      <h2>Conservation Concerns</h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, these birds are under pressure due to habitat
        destruction, logging, and hunting. Since they depend on large, mature
        trees for nesting, deforestation poses a serious threat to their
        survival.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pictures shown here were captured in Yala National Park, one of Sri
        Lanka's most important wildlife reserves. It is only because of
        protected national forests like Yala that species such as the Malabar
        Pied Hornbill still survive today. Without these sanctuaries, they would
        likely have been long gone. Protecting these habitats is not just about
        preserving beauty—it's about safeguarding the very existence of these
        magnificent birds.
