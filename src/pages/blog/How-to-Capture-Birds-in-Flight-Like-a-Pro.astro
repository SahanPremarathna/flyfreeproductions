    <h2>1. Use a Fast Shutter Speed</h2>
    <p>
      To freeze a birdâ€™s motion, set your shutter speed to at least 1/1000s. Higher speeds such as 1/2000s work better for faster birds or windy conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Continuous Autofocus Mode</h2>
    <p>
      Switch your camera to continuous autofocus (AI Servo for Canon, AF-C for Nikon/Sony). This keeps the bird sharp as it moves across the frame.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Practice Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Smoothly pan your camera to follow the bird. Try pre-focusing on a spot and wait for the bird to enter the frame to reduce autofocus lag.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <p>
      With patience and practice, you'll capture breathtaking images that tell the story of flight.
