                This step-by-step guide is designed for complete beginners using
                the free version of DaVinci Resolve. We'll break the entire
                color grading process into five main stages, each handled on a
                separate serial node, to help you achieve clean, cinematic
                results for wildlife and nature videos.

        <section class="post-content">
            <h2>1. Controlling the Light</h2>
            <p>
                The first node focuses on adjusting the amount of light in your
                footage. For wildlife content, it's often best to leave a little
                extra brightness, as this gives you more flexibility in the
                final step. Use the lift, gamma, and gain controls to calm
                overly bright highlights and gently brighten shadows. Always
                preview the entire clip while making adjustments, as these
                controls are sensitive and can introduce noise if pushed too
                far.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enable the <strong>waveform</strong> panel to fine-tune highlights
                and shadows. As a general guide, keep clean highlights under <em
                    >[insert ideal waveform value]</em
                > and shadows around <em>[insert value]</em> to maintain detail.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Adjusting the Tone (White Balance)</h2>
            <p>
                The second node is all about tone, which is controlled through
                white balance. Think back to the actual lighting conditions when
                filming—your goal is to recreate the mood of that moment, not to
                change it entirely. If you used an ND filter, make sure to also
                adjust the <strong>tint</strong> for accurate color reproduction.
                If you did not use ND filters, leave the tint untouched to avoid
                unnecessary color shifts.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Enhancing Basic Colors</h2>
            <p>
                In the third node, we work on contrast, saturation, and color
                boost—three settings that can dramatically improve your footage
                when used carefully. Start with a contrast value around <strong
                    >1.5</strong
                > (adjust up or down depending on how much separation you want between
                subject and background). Keep in mind that too much contrast can
                increase noise in both shadows and highlights.
            </p>
            <p>
                For wildlife content, subtlety is key—preserve the original
                colors as much as possible. A good starting point is <strong
                    >saturation: 54-56</strong
                > and <strong>color boost: 4-8</strong>, but these values can be
                tweaked to match your creative vision.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Selective Color Grading (Optional)</h2>
            <p>
                This step is optional for beginners but can make a huge
                difference in professional work. Using qualifiers and power
                windows, you can isolate specific colors or areas in the frame
                and adjust them independently. Depending on the complexity of
                your shot, this can range from one node to over 20 nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since this topic is more advanced, we'll cover selective grading
                in detail in a future guide.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Applying CST (For LOG Footage)</h2>
            <p>
                If you've recorded in a LOG format using professional gear, add
                a CST (Color Space Transform) node before the final grading
                step. You can find it in the <strong>Effects</strong> panel—drag
                it onto your node, select your camera manufacturer, and apply the
                correct input/output color spaces.
            </p>

            <h2>6. The Finishing Touch</h2>
            <p>
                The final node is where we give the footage a cinematic polish
                using the custom curves tool. Imagine the curve divided into two
                halves by a middle point (X). From X to the right (highlights),
                lift the curve slightly. From X to the left (shadows), lower it
                slightly. This creates a gentle S-curve, adding depth and
                richness to your image.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                These steps form a solid foundation for beginners, but
                remember—color grading is both a technical and creative process.
                The exact settings will vary depending on your footage, and
                there's no single “correct” way to grade. The more you practice
                on different types of footage, the more you'll develop your own
                style and intuition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use this structure as a starting point, experiment, and most
                importantly—enjoy the process.
