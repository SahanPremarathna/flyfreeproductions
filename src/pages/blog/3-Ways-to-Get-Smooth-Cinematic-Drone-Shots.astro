                Cinematic drone shots can turn ordinary aerial footage into breathtaking storytelling. 
                In this guide, we’ll cover three simple but powerful shot types you can master to create smooth, professional-looking videos, 
                along with step-by-step instructions to fly them confidently.

            <h2>1. The Reveal Shot</h2>
            <p>
                The reveal shot slowly introduces your subject into the frame, building anticipation for the viewer.
                You can perform this by starting behind a foreground object—such as a tree, cliff, or building—and then 
                flying upward, sideways, or forward to uncover the scene.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to perform:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce gimbal pitch speed in your settings for smoother motion.</li>
                <li>Start close to a foreground object with your gimbal angled slightly downward.</li>
                <li>Fly backward, forward, or ascend while slowly pitching the gimbal upward to reveal the scene.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. The Orbit Shot (Point of Interest)</h2>
            <p>
                The orbit shot circles your subject while keeping it perfectly centered. 
                It’s ideal for showcasing landmarks, landscapes, or even people from all angles in a single smooth motion.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to perform:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fly to your desired distance from the subject and keep it framed at the center.</li>
                <li>Move the yaw and roll controls together in opposite directions to create a smooth arc.</li>
                <li>Keep the altitude steady for a balanced cinematic look.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. The Push-In / Pull-Out (Dolly Shot)</h2>
            <p>
                This shot mimics the effect of a camera dolly in film production—either moving toward (push-in) 
                or away from (pull-out) your subject. It’s a simple way to create depth and draw attention to your main focus.
            </p>
            <p><strong>How to perform:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For a push-in, start far from the subject and fly toward it while keeping the gimbal locked on the subject.</li>
                <li>For a pull-out, start close and fly backward to reveal more of the surroundings.</li>
                <li>Use slow, steady stick inputs to avoid jerky motion.</li>
                <li>Activate a “cinema” or “tripod” flight mode for more precise control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Tips for Smooth Cinematics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use slower gimbal and flight control settings to achieve gentle movements.</li>
                <li>Plan your shots before takeoff to save time and battery.</li>
                <li>Fly in calm weather to avoid sudden shakes from wind gusts.</li>
                <li>Experiment with combining moves—like a reveal and an orbit—for unique results.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These three fundamental drone shots—the reveal, orbit, and push-in/pull-out—are the foundation of cinematic aerial filmmaking. 
                Master them, and you’ll be able to create footage that feels smooth, engaging, and visually stunning.
