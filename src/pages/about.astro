            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                FlyFree began with a homemade drone and a simple camera,
                capturing aerial glimpses of our village. The early footage was
                shaky, but it sparked something special. Over time, we were able
                to upgrade to a professional drone, and FlyFree officially took
                flight as an aerial footage channel based in Sri Lanka. Soon
                after, we invested in a camera and essential gear, opening new
                doors to explore more than just skies. From birds in the
                wetlands to hidden wildlife trails, our journey expanded into
                the rich natural wonders of Sri Lanka. We're still learning,
                growing, and capturing. This is only the beginning of our path
                to uncover the unseen and share the quiet beauty of the world
                around us.
